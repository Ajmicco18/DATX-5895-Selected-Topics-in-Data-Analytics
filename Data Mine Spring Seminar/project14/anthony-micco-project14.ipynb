    "My favorite data set to work with during this semester was the flights dataset. The flights dataset was enjoyable to work with because it had so much data that we had to limit the data specifying the columns we wanted and the column types. It also contained some really neat data such as departure and arrival delay that was interesting to manipulate and analyze throughout the semester. Utilizing this dataset, I was able to learn many different ways to analyze the data such as numpy and pandas functions, as well as python math functions. This is illustrated in Question 2 of project 10 where I was manipulating the Departure Delay delay with the nan_to_num function in numpy."

    "Out of all the functions I have utilized this semester, my favorite function was the super() function we used when working with classes during the last couple projects. I had utilized inheritance in programming languages such as C++ and Java, but I had never done any inheritance in Python, so I thought it was unique to use that function instead of using the extends syntax when defining the child class. Question 1 of Project 12 depicts where I was using the super() function when defining the ScheduledFlight class. "

I utilized this approach in Question 3 of Project 7 where I was creating a function to return a dictionary that contained each element codes' amount of snowfall."

In addition, I would like to learn more about Flask and how to display the data we produce on a separate webpage. I have had some experience in web development, so I believe it would be beneficial for me to learn another type of web framework that I can utilize in a potential career.
