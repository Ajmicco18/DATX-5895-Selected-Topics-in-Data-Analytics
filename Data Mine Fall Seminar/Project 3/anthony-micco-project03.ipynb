    "B) One observation I have made from the data is that since about 2009, the average price of cars has increased for the most part with a few, small dips coming in 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, I noticed the sudden, sharp drops in average price between 2003 and 2004, as well as between 2008 and 2009.In addition, the plot has a single outlier in 2019, with it being the only year where the average price was over $30000.
